## Introduction

Data extraction is a crucial process in the world of data analysis and data science. It involves retrieving specific information from various sources and transforming it into a usable format. This repository aims to provide examples and code snippets that demonstrate how to extract data from diverse sources using different techniques and technologies.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies and methods are utilized in this repository:

- **Regex**: Regular expressions are used to match and extract patterns from text data.
- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**: OCR technology is employed to extract text from images and scanned documents.
- **Web Scraping**: Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Scrapy are utilized to extract data from websites.
- **ZIP**: Python's zipfile library is used to extract data from ZIP archives.
- **JSON**: Data is extracted from JSON files using Python's json library.
- **GeoJSON**: GeoJSON data is parsed and extracted for geographical data manipulation.
- **XML**: XML data is parsed to extract relevant information.
- **YAML**: Data is extracted from YAML files using Python's PyYAML library.
- **SQL**: Data extraction is demonstrated using SQL queries to interact with databases.
- **API**: Examples are provided to interact with APIs and extract data from web services.
